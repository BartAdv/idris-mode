# Changes

## 0.9.18

 * The variable `idris-packages` has been renamed to
   `idris-load-packages`. If you have this as a file variable, please
   rename it.
 * The faces `idris-quasiquotation-face` and
   `idris-antiquotation-face` have been added, for compiler-supported
   highlighting of quotations. They are, by default, without
   properties, but they can be customized if desired.
